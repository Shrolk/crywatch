![crywatch — multi-camera grid with an AI cry alert firing on one tile](docs/hero.png)

<sub>*Grid view with the cry alert firing on the Bedroom camera (demo — placeholder feeds).*</sub>

A private, self-hosted baby monitor that **actually knows the difference between
crying and just being loud**. Camera feeds stream to your phone over WebRTC — nothing
touches a vendor cloud — and a small AI model pushes an alert only when it hears a
real baby cry (not the vacuum, the TV, or you talking).

Two small pieces:

- **`viewer/`** — a dependency-free web viewer: multi-camera grid, tap-to-expand,
  pinch-zoom, mobile portrait feed, and a startup spinner. Talks to
  [go2rtc](https://github.com/AlexxIT/go2rtc) via WebRTC.
- **`cry-detector/`** — a server-side classifier that runs **Google's YAMNet**
  (AudioSet) on short audio clips and pushes a [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh) notification
  when it detects crying. **Runs on CPU. No GPU required.**

---

## Why

Off-the-shelf monitor apps round-trip through the vendor's cloud — laggy, and I'd
rather my kid's nursery feed not live on someone else's server. And the "smart"
alerts are usually just a loudness threshold, so they fire on *everything* loud.
This fixes both: fully self-hosted, and it classifies the *sound* instead of
measuring volume.

## Architecture

```
  IP cameras ──RTSP──> go2rtc ──WebRTC──> browser viewer (phone/desktop, over VPN)
                          │
                          └──RTSP(audio)──> cry-detector ──> YAMNet ──> ntfy push
                                            (short 16kHz clips)         (phone asleep OK)
```

- **go2rtc** is the hub: it pulls RTSP from the cameras and re-serves WebRTC to the
  browser (WebRTC gives sub-second latency and plays the cameras' PCMA audio).
- The **viewer** is static HTML/JS — host it anywhere (go2rtc can serve it, or any
  web server).
- The **cry-detector** pulls audio-only from go2rtc, classifies it, and posts to ntfy.

## What you need

- One or more **RTSP/ONVIF cameras** (most expose a main + sub stream). The stream
  you *view* must be **H.264** — browsers can't play H.265/HEVC over WebRTC.
- **[go2rtc](https://github.com/AlexxIT/go2rtc)** (Docker).
- **[ntfy](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy)** for push (self-hosted or ntfy.sh),
  and the ntfy app on your phone.
- **Docker** for the cry detector.
- **Optional — remote access:** a VPN (**Tailscale** is easiest, or WireGuard) only if
  you want to watch the *live video* while away from home. Not needed for cry alerts,
  and never port-forward these unauthenticated ports to the internet (see
  [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)).

## Minimal setup (no VPN, no Frigate)

You do **not** need Frigate (a separate NVR) or a VPN to use this. The only hard
requirements are **cameras + go2rtc + Docker + ntfy**.

**What works where:**

| Where you are | Self-hosted ntfy (Compose default) | Public ntfy.sh |
|---|---|---|
| **At home** (same Wi-Fi) — live video + alerts | ✅ no VPN | ✅ no VPN |
| **Away** — cry alerts | 🔒 needs VPN | ✅ no VPN |
| **Away** — live video | 🔒 needs VPN | 🔒 needs VPN |

To watch live video while away (or to get self-hosted alerts remotely), add a VPN —
see the **Remote access (Tailscale)** section below.

- **At home (same Wi-Fi):** just open `http://<server-ip>:1985/multi.html` — no VPN.
- **Away from home:** a phone on cellular / other Wi-Fi *cannot* reach your home
  network by default (it's behind NAT/firewall). To watch live video remotely, add
  **Tailscale** (install on the server + phone, log into the same account — ~5 min).
  Do **not** port-forward go2rtc to the internet; it has no authentication.
- **Cry alerts — depends on your ntfy:** with the **public ntfy.sh**
  (`NTFY_URL=https://ntfy.sh/<topic>`), pushes reach your phone **anywhere, no VPN**.
  With a **self-hosted** ntfy (the Compose default, kept on your LAN) your phone must be
  able to reach it — on home Wi-Fi or on the VPN — to receive alerts while away.

ntfy can be the public **ntfy.sh** (pick a hard-to-guess topic — zero setup) or
self-hosted.

## Quick start (Docker Compose)

Brings up the whole stack — go2rtc, the viewer, the cry detector, and ntfy:

```bash
cp examples/go2rtc.example.yaml go2rtc.yaml   # add your cameras (IPs + credentials)
cp .env.example .env                          # set your ntfy topic, cameras, tuning
docker compose up -d --build
```

Then open `http://<server-ip>:1985/multi.html?cams=cam1,cam2&labels=Nursery,Bedroom`
and subscribe to your topic in the ntfy app. That's it — only two files to edit
(`go2rtc.yaml` for your cameras, `.env` for your ntfy topic).

- Prefer zero-setup push? Delete the `ntfy` service in `docker-compose.yml` and set
  `NTFY_URL=https://ntfy.sh/<your-unique-topic>` in `.env`.
- Want to run the pieces by hand instead? See the manual steps below.

## Running on macOS / Windows (Docker Desktop)

This stack is built for a **Linux host** (a NAS, mini-PC, an old laptop on Linux, a Pi,
or a VPS) — that's what you'd run a 24/7 monitor on. On **Docker Desktop** (macOS /
Windows) Docker runs inside a Linux VM, so `network_mode: host` refers to that VM, not
your computer. The **cry detector, push, and the viewer page all work fine** — only the
**WebRTC live video** needs a tweak, because host networking + auto ICE candidates don't
reach the browser. Two options:

**A. (easiest) Enable Docker Desktop host networking.** Recent Docker Desktop has
*Settings → Resources → Network → Enable host networking* (beta). Turn it on and the
default `docker-compose.yml` may work as-is.

**B. Use published ports + a WebRTC candidate:**

1. In `docker-compose.yml`, remove `network_mode: host` from **both** `go2rtc` and
   `cry-detector`, and give `go2rtc` published ports:
   ```yaml
   go2rtc:
     image: alexxit/go2rtc:latest
     ports: ["1984:1984", "8554:8554", "8555:8555/tcp", "8555:8555/udp"]
     volumes:
       - ./go2rtc.yaml:/config/go2rtc.yaml:ro
   ```
2. In `go2rtc.yaml`, advertise your computer's LAN IP so the browser can reach WebRTC:
   ```yaml
   webrtc:
     listen: ":8555"
     candidates:
       - <YOUR_LAN_IP>:8555      # e.g. 192.168.1.50:8555
   ```
3. In `.env`, point the detector at the service names instead of localhost:
   ```
   GO2RTC_RTSP=rtsp://go2rtc:8554
   NTFY_URL=http://ntfy/<your-topic>
   ```

On Linux none of this is needed — host networking handles it, which is why it's the
default. For a long-running monitor, a small Linux box is the smoothest option.

## Setup (manual, without Compose)

### 1. go2rtc + cameras

```bash
cp examples/go2rtc.example.yaml go2rtc.yaml   # edit: your camera IPs + credentials
# run go2rtc (Docker) pointing at go2rtc.yaml — see go2rtc docs
```

Name your streams `cam1`, `cam1_hd`, `cam2`, … (or anything — just match the viewer/
detector config).

### 2. Viewer

Serve `viewer/` from any web server (or point go2rtc's static dir at it). Then open:

```
http://<host>:1985/multi.html?cams=cam1,cam2&labels=Nursery,Bedroom
```

- Tap a tile (⛶) to expand it and switch to its HD stream; ✕ to go back.
- Pinch/scroll to zoom, drag to pan, 🔔 toggles a lightweight in-browser cry flash.
- Defaults (streams/labels, and the grid→HD map) are near the top of `multi.html`.

`index.html` is a single-camera version: `index.html?src=cam1`.

### 3. Cry detector

```bash
cp .env.example .env        # edit NTFY_URL, GO2RTC_RTSP, CAMS, …
set -a; . ./.env; set +a    # load it
cd cry-detector && ./run.sh # builds the image and starts the container
docker logs -f baby-cry-detector
```

On the phone: install the **ntfy** app, point it at your server, and subscribe to
the topic in `NTFY_URL`. Alerts arrive even with the phone asleep.

## Remote access (optional — Tailscale, ~5 min)

Everything above works on your home Wi-Fi with no VPN. To watch the **live video**
while away from home, put the server and your phone on the same private network with
[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) (WireGuard under the hood, but zero-config):

1. **On the server** — install and bring it up:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
   sudo tailscale up
   ```
   Note its Tailscale address (`100.x.y.z`, or a MagicDNS name like `myserver`).
2. **On your phone** — install the Tailscale app and log in with the **same account**.
3. From anywhere, open `http://<tailscale-address>:1985/multi.html`.
4. *(Recommended)* set `CRY_CLICK_URL` to that Tailscale address, so tapping a cry
   notification opens the camera even when you're away.

> **Do not** port-forward go2rtc to the internet — it has no authentication. Keeping it
> behind Tailscale (or WireGuard) is what makes remote access safe. Prefer self-hosted
> **WireGuard**? Same idea, more setup — out of scope here.

## Tuning

Watch live classifications with `CRY_LOG=1` (`docker logs -f baby-cry-detector`):

```
[Nursery] cry=0.00 rms=-72dB top='(silence)' streak=0
[Bedroom] cry=1.00 rms=-25dB top='Crying, sobbing' streak=2   -> push!
```

| var | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `CRY_PROB` | `0.4` | cry probability 0–1 to trigger. Raise if false alarms, lower if it misses. |
| `CRY_SUSTAIN_SAMPLES` | `2` | consecutive cry samples before alerting |
| `CRY_COOLDOWN` | `60` | min seconds between alerts |
| `CRY_RMS_GATE_DB` | `-60` | skip the model below this loudness (silence) |
| `CRY_SAMPLE_SEC` | `2.0` | audio seconds per sample |

In my testing, real baby cries score **0.5–1.0**; speech peaks around **0.27**; and
cough / clap / dog / laughing / alarm — and a **vacuum cleaner** (the loudest sound
of the lot) — all score **~0.00**. That's the whole point: loud ≠ crying.

## Hardware

The cry detector is **CPU-only** (CPU-only TensorFlow) — a NUC or NAS handles it fine.
A GPU is only useful if you separately transcode a 4K H.265 camera down to H.264 for
the browser (out of scope here — see go2rtc's `ffmpeg:` source or a mediamtx + NVENC
relay).

## Security

Please read **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)**. Short version: never commit secrets
(camera passwords, `.conf`/`.key`, tokens, DBs — all gitignored), keep real config
local (`go2rtc.yaml`, `.env`), and reach everything over a VPN, not a port-forward.
